There are many people or i would say foodiesðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… who want to cook different foods but don't know how to cook . So here we are with a project that focuses on not only helping foodies to cook and eat what they want to but also help them order it if they just end up burning the kitchen( for which i pray that it should not happen). Here you will fing different type of dishes depending on wether you are a vegeterian or a Non - Vegeterian. You will find different ways to cook your faviourate dishes.

So What are you waiting for, just search what you want --> Cook --> Eat --> Enjoy!
